# Search Algorithm - Genetic Algorithm WHPP


My implementation of search methods DFS, BFS, A*, Online LTRA* and Genetic Algorithm WHPP 


# Execution Steps 

- Genetic Algorithm execution 

1. Go to  /Genetic-Algorithm folder
2. Simply execute java jar with file name **Genetic-Algorithm.jar**. For example execution in linux with the command 
```sh
$ java -jar Genetic-Algorithm.jar
```

- Search Methods execution

1. Go to /SearchMethods
2. Simply execute java jar with file name **SearchMethods.jar**. There is also another folder /world_examples, which inluedes some sample worlds requested in the reports .For a full example execution in linux with the command 
```sh
$ java -jar SearchMethods.jar -i world_examples/hard_b.world
```

# Java Preresiquites

The project is expected to run for every version above Java 8. Project build environment
